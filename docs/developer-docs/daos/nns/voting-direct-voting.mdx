# Voting

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Governance", "Concept"]} />

## Overview
The NNS DAO is an open governance system where anyone can become a participant by [staking some ICP in a neuron](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/nns-app-quickstart#stake-icp-utility-tokens-in-a-neuron) and locking the tokens for at least 6 months. Locking tokens for a period of time is known as the neuron's dissolve delay.

More technically, to participate in the NNS governance, users can stake some ICP tokens in a neuron. At least 1 ICP are required to create a neuron.
If a neuron has more than 6 months dissolve delay, it is eligible to participate in voting. This means that it can both submit and vote on proposals.


## Finding proposals and discussions

You can see all the NNS proposals on the [Internet Computer dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/governance) or on the [NNS dapp](https://nns.ic0.app/). Voters can freely discuss proposals anywhere they like. A lot of NNS proposals are discussed on the [developer forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/c/roadmap/29).

## Direct voting
When a user has an eligible neuron and would like to vote on an open proposal, one option is to directly vote to adopt or reject the proposal.
Currently, the most user-friendly way to first find and [vote on open proposals](/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/nns-app-quickstart#vote-on-proposals) is via the NNS Frontend dapp: https://nns.ic0.app/.
