# Following

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Governance", "Concept"]} />

## Overview
Users may not have the time or knowledge to participate in all voting decisions. Therefore, instead of directly voting on proposals, neuron holders may choose to delegate their vote to other neurons that they trust with certain decisions. This concept of delegating the right to vote to other neurons, who then effectively vote with more voting power, is called **liquid democracy**. In the NNS DAO, this is also called **following**, as a neuron follows the decision of some other neurons.

### How to follow a neuron
Concretely, proposals are grouped into different [**proposal topics**](./proposal-voting.mdx#proposal-topics-and-types) and following is done on a per-topic basis.
To learn more about the follow rules and how to set up your neuron to follow a group of other neurons on the NNS dapp, refer to [NNS dapp quickstart for following](/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/nns-app-quickstart#neuron-following).

### How to find neurons to follow
In order for a neuron to follow others, there needs to be some neurons that actively vote and can be followed.

There are two ways neurons to follow can be found and set:
* A user with an actively voting neuron who is offering to be followed can communicate their neuron ID to others, for example on the forum or their website. Other neurons can then [follow them](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/nns-app-quickstart#step-5-enter-a-neuron-id-to-follow-or-select-a-group-of-neurons-from-the-menu-provided) using this neuron ID.
* A user with an actively voting neuron who is offering to be followed can register a **known neuron**, also called a **named neuron**, in the NNS governance canister. Neurons who would like to follow others can see a list of all registered neurons with their name and optionally a short description, and can then select one of them to follow (without having to remember an ID).
